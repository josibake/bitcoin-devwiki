# Motivation

## Basic Usability Issues

### Spam/Lack of Moderator Queue

The repo has thousands of subscribers, so any spam contribution or otherwise inappropriate comment will reach all those inboxes before being deleted by a maintainer.

GitHub fails to provide simple and effective tools (such as rate limits for non-members or a moderator queue) to fight low-quality content.

## Centralization/Single Point of Failure

The repo is primarily accessed through GitHub, which might (even against their will) shut down hosting at any point in time.

Instead of hopping to another centralized provider or self-hosted single point of failure, a goal should be to evaluate decentralized or federated hosters.
