Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

Notable changes
===============

Manual Pruning
--------------

Bitcoin Core has supported automatically pruning the blockchain since 0.11. Pruning
the blockchain allows for significant storage space savings as the vast majority of
the downloaded data can be discarded after processing so very little of it remains
on the disk.

Manual block pruning can now be enabled by setting `-prune=1`. Once that is set,
the RPC command `pruneblockchain` can be used to prune the blockchain up to the
specified height or timestamp.

`getinfo` Deprecated
--------------------

The `getinfo` RPC command has been deprecated. Each field in the RPC call
has been moved to another command's output with that command also giving
additional information that `getinfo` did not provide. The following table
shows where each field has been moved to:

|`getinfo` field | Moved to|
|----------------|---------|
"version"	 |getnetworkinfo()["version"]
"protocolversion"|	getnetworkinfo()["protocolversion"]
"walletversion"	 |getwalletinfo()["walletversion"]
"balance"	 |getwalletinfo()["balance"]
"blocks"	 |getblockchaininfo()["blocks"]
"timeoffset"	 |getnetworkinfo()["timeoffset"]
"connections"	 |getnetworkinfo()["connections"]
"proxy"	         |getnetworkinfo()["networks"][0]["proxy"]
"difficulty"	 |getblockchaininfo()["difficulty"]
"testnet"	 |getblockchaininfo()["chain"] == "test"
"keypoololdest"	 |getwalletinfo()["keypoololdest"]
"keypoolsize"	 |getwalletinfo()["keypoolsize"]
"unlocked_until" |getwalletinfo()["unlocked_until"]
"paytxfee"	 |getwalletinfo()["paytxfee"]
"relayfee"	 |getnetworkinfo()["relayfee"]
"errors"	 |getnetworkinfo()["warnings"]

ZMQ On Windows
--------------

Previously the ZeroMQ notification system was unavailable on Windows
due to various issues with ZMQ. These have been fixed upstream and
now ZMQ can be used on Windows. Please see [this document](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/zmq.md) for
help with using ZMQ in general.

Nested RPC Commands in Debug Console
------------------------------------

The ability to nest RPC commands has been added to the debug console. This
allows users to have the output of a command become the input to another
command without running the commands separately.

The nested RPC commands use bracket syntax (i.e. `getwalletinfo()`) and can
be nested (i.e. `sendtoaddress(getnewaddress(), 10)`). Simple queries can be
done with square brackets where object values are accessed with either an 
array index or a non-quoted string (i.e. `listunspent()[0][txid]`). Both
commas and spaces can be used to separate parameters in both the bracket syntax
and normal RPC command syntax.

Network Activity Toggle
-----------------------

A RPC command and GUI toggle have been added to enable or disable all p2p
network activity. The network status icon in the bottom right hand corner 
is now the GUI toggle. Clicking the icon will either enable or disable all
p2p network activity. If network activity is disabled, the icon will 
be grayed out with an X on top of it.

Additionally the `setnetworkactive` RPC command has been added which does
the same thing as the GUI icon. The command takes one boolean parameter,
`true` enables networking and `false` disables it.

Support for JSON-RPC Named Arguments
------------------------------------

Commands sent over the JSON-RPC interface and through the bitcoin-cli binary
can now use named arguments. These named arguments strictly follow the
JSON-RPC specification so using both named and positional arguments like in
python is not supported.

Opt into Full-RBF When Sending
------------------------------

A new startup option, `-walletrbf`, has been added to allow users to have all
transactions sent opt into Full-RBF. The default value for this option is `false`
so transactions will not opt into Full-RBF by default.

Sensitive data is no longer stored in the debug console history
---------------------------------------------------------------

The debug console maintains a history of previously entered commands that can be
accessed by pressing the Up-arrow key so that users can easily reuse previously
entered commands. Commands which have sensitive information such as passphrases and
private keys will now have a `(...)` in place of the parameters when accessed through
the history.

Retaining the Mempool Across Restarts
-------------------------------------

The mempool will be saved to the data directory every 10 minutes and prior to shutdown
to a `mempool.dat` file. This file preserves the mempool so that when the node
restarts the mempool can be filled with transactions without waiting for new transactions
to be created. This will also preserve any changes made to a transaction through
commands such as `prioritisetransaction` so that those changes will not be lost.

GUI Changes
-----------

 - After resetting the options by clicking the `Reset Options` button 
   in the options dialog or with the `-resetguioptions` startup option, 
   the user will be prompted to choose the data directory again. This 
   is to ensure that custom data directories will be kept after the 
   option reset which clears the custom data directory set via the choose 
   datadir dialog.

 - Multiple peers can now be selected in the list of peers in the debug 
   window. This allows for users to ban or disconnect multiple peers 
   simultaneously instead of banning them one at a time.

 - An indicator has been added to the bottom right hand corner of the main
   window to indicate whether the wallet being used is a HD wallet. This
   icon will be grayed out with an X on top of it if the wallet is not a
   HD wallet.

Low-level RPC changes
----------------------

- `importprunedfunds` only accepts two required arguments. Some versions accept
  an optional third arg, which was always ignored. Make sure to never pass more
  than two arguments.

 - The first boolean argument to `getaddednodeinfo` has been removed. This is 
   an incompatible change.

 - RPC command "getmininginfo" loses the "testnet" field in favor of the more
   generic "chain" (which has beenpresent for years).

 - A new RPC command `preciousblock` has been added which marks a block as
   precious. A precious block will be treated as if it were received earlier
   than a competing block.

 - A new RPC command `importmulti` has been added which receives an array of 
   JSON objects representing the intention of importing a public key, a 
   private key, an address and script/p2sh

 - Use of `getrawtransaction` for retrieving confirmed transactions with unspent
   outputs has been deprecated. For now this will still work, but in the future
   it may change to only be able to retrieve information about transactions in
   the mempool or if `txindex` is enabled.

HTTP REST Changes
-----------------

 - UTXO set query (`GET /rest/getutxos/<checkmempool>/<txid>-<n>/<txid>-<n>
   /.../<txid>-<n>.<bin|hex|json>`) responses were changed to return status 
   code HTTP_BAD_REQUEST (400) instead of HTTP_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR (500)
   when requests contain invalid parameters.

Fee Estimation Changes
----------------------

- Since 0.13.2 fee estimation for a confirmation target of 1 block has been
  disabled. The fee slider will no longer be able to choose a target of 1 block.
  This is only a minor behavior change as there was often insufficient
  data for this target anyway. `estimatefee 1` will now always return -1 and
  `estimatesmartfee 1` will start searching at a target of 2.

- The default target for fee estimation is changed to 6 blocks in both the GUI
  (previously 25) and for RPC calls (previously 2).

Removal of Priority Estimation
------------------------------

- Estimation of "priority" needed for a transaction to be included within a target
  number of blocks has been removed.  The rpc calls are deprecated and will either
  return -1 or 1e24 appropriately. The format for `fee_estimates.dat` has also
  changed to no longer save these priority estimates. It will automatically be
  converted to the new format which is not readable by prior versions of the
  software.

- The concept of "priority" (coin age) transactions is planned to be removed in
  the next major version. To prepare for this, the default for the rate limit of
  priority transactions (`-limitfreerelay`) has been set to `0` kB/minute. This
  is not to be confused with the `prioritisetransaction` RPC which will remain
  supported for adding fee deltas to transactions.

P2P connection management
--------------------------

- Peers manually added through the addnode option or addnode RPC now have their own
  limit of eight connections which does not compete with other inbound or outbound
  connection usage and is not subject to the maxconnections limitation.

- New connections to manually added peers are much faster.
