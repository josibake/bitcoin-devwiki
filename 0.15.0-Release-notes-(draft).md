How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), uninstall all
earlier versions of Bitcoin, then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy
over /Applications/Bitcoin-Qt (on Mac) or `bitcoind`/`bitcoin-qt` (on Linux).

The first time you run version 0.15.0, your chainstate database will be converted to a
new format, which will take anywhere from a few minutes to half an hour,
depending on the speed of your machine.

On Windows, do not forget to uninstall all earlier versions of the Bitcoin
client first.

Note that the block database format changed in version 0.8.0 and there is no
automatic upgrade code from before version 0.8 to version 0.15.0. If you are
running a version older than version 0.8.0, you will need to do **one** of the
following to upgrade to version 0.15.0:

1. (recommended) upgrade to version 0.14.x first, start-stop the node and then
   upgrade to version 0.15; or
2. Upgrade to version 0.15 directly. This will result in a full redownload of the
   blockchain, and old unused `blknnnn.dat` files being left in the data directory.
   These can be safely removed (but be careful not to remove any other files in the
   data directory or any of the `blknnnnn.dat` files in the `blocks` subdirectory).

Downgrading warning
-------------------

The chainstate database for this release is not compatible with previous
releases, so if you run 0.15 and then decide to switch back to any
older version, you will need to run the old release with the `-reindex-chainstate`
option to rebuild the chainstate data structures in the old format.

If your node has pruning enabled, this will entail re-downloading and
processing the entire blockchain.

Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later. Windows XP is not supported.

Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

Notable changes
===============

Performance Improvements
------------------------

Version 0.15 contains a number of significant performance improvements, which make
Initial Block Download, transaction and block validation much faster:

- The chainstate database (which is used for tracking UTXOs) has been changed
  from a per-transaction model to a per-output model. Advantages of this model
  are that it:
    - avoids the CPU overhead of deserializing and serializing the unused outputs;
    - has more predictable memory usage;
    - uses simpler code;
    - is adaptable to various cache flushing strategies.

  As a result, validating the blockchain during Initial Block Download (IBD) and reindex
  is ~30-40% faster, uses 10-20% less memory, and flushes to disk far less frequently.
  The only downside is that the on-disk database is 15% larger. During the conversion from the previous format
  a few extra gigabytes may be used.
- Earlier versions experienced a spike in memory usage while flushing UTXO updates to disk.
  As a result, only half of the available memory was actually used as cache, and the other half was
  reserved to accommodate flushing. This is no longer the case, and the entirety of
  the available cache (see `-dbcache`) is now actually used as cache. This reduces the flushing
  frequency by a factor 2 or more.
- In previous versions, signature validation for transactions has been cached when the
  transaction is accepted to the mempool. Version 0.15 extends this to cache the entire script
  validity. This means that if a transaction in a block has already been accepted to the
  mempool, the scriptSig does not need to be re-evaluated. Empirical tests show that
  this results in new block validation being 40-50% faster.
- LevelDB has been upgraded to version 1.20. This version contains hardware acceleration for CRC
  on architectures supporting SSE 4.2. As a result, synchronization and block validation are now faster.
- SHA256 hashing has been optimized for architectures supporting SSE 4. SHA256 is around
  50% faster on supported hardware, which results in around 5% faster IBD and block
  validation. In version 0.15, SHA256 hardware optimization is disabled in release builds by
  default, but can be enabled by using `--enable-experimental-asm` when building.

Multi-wallet support
--------------------

Bitcoin Core now supports loading multiple, separate wallets. The wallets are completely separated, with individual balances, keys and received transactions.

Multi-wallet is enabled by using more than one `-wallet` argument when starting Bitcoin, either on the command line or in the Bitcoin config file.

In Bitcoin-Qt, only the first wallet will be displayed and accessible for creating and signing transactions. However, the other wallets will continue to remain synchronized to the node's current tip in the background. This can be useful if running a pruned node, since loading a wallet where the most recent sync is beyond the pruned height results in having to download and revalidate the whole blockchain. Continuing to synchronize all wallets in the background avoids this problem.

Bitcoin Core 0.15.0 contains the following changes to the RPC interface and `bitcoin-cli` for multi-wallet:

* When running Bitcoin Core with a single wallet, there are **no** changes to the RPC interface or `bitcoin-cli`. All RPC calls and `bitcoin-cli` commands continue to work as before.
* When running Bitcoin Core with multi-wallet, all *node-level* RPC methods continue to work as before. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the normal `<RPC IP address>:<RPC port>/` endpoint, and `bitcoin-cli` commands should be run as before. A *node-level* RPC method is any method which does not require access to the wallet.
* When running Bitcoin Core with multi-wallet, *wallet-level* RPC methods must specify the wallet for which they're intended in every request. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the `<RPC IP address>:<RPC port>/wallet/<wallet name>/` endpoint, for example `127.0.0.1:8332/wallet/wallet1.dat/`. `bitcoin-cli` commands should be run with a `-rpcwallet` option, for example `bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=wallet1.dat getbalance`.
* A new *node-level* `listwallets` RPC method is added to display which wallets are currently loaded. The names returned by this method are the same as those used in the HTTP endpoint and for the `rpcwallet` argument.

Note that while multi-wallet is now fully supported, the RPC multi-wallet interface should be considered unstable for version 0.15.0, and there may backwards-incompatible changes in future versions.

Replace-by-fee control in the GUI
---------------------------------

Bitcoin Core has supported creating opt-in replace-by-fee (RBF) transactions
since version 0.12.0, and since version 0.14.0 has included a `bumpfee` RPC method to
replace unconfirmed opt-in RBF transactions with a new transaction that pays
a higher fee.

In version 0.15, creating an opt-in RBF transaction and replacing the unconfirmed
transaction with a higher-fee transaction are both supported in the GUI.

Changes to the estimatesmartfee API
-----------------------------------

The `estimatesmartfee` RPC interface has changed:

- The `nblocks` argument has been renamed to `conf_target` (to
  be consistent with other RPC methods).
- The `conservative` argument has been removed and replaced by
  an `estimate_mode` argument. This argument takes one of the
  following strings: `CONSERVATIVE`, `ECONOMICAL` or `UNSET`
  (which defaults to `CONSERVATIVE`). Selecting `CONSERVATIVE`
  will potentially return a higher feerate and is more likely
  to be sufficient for the desired target, but is not as
  responsive to short term drops in the prevailing fee market.
- The RPC return object now contains an `errors` member, which
  returns errors encountered during processing.
- If Bitcoin Core has not been running for long enough and has not
  seen enough blocks or transactions to produce an accurate fee
  estimation, an error will be returned (previously a negative
  value `feerate` was returned).

Removal of Coin Age Priority
----------------------------

In previous versions of Bitcoin Core, a portion of each block could be reserved for transactions based on the age and value of UTXOs they spent. This concept (Coin Age Priority) is a policy choice by miners, and there are no consensus rules around the inclusion of Coin Age Priority transactions in blocks. In practice, only a few miners continue to use Coin Age Priority for transaction selection in blocks. Bitcoin Core 0.15 removes all remaining support for Coin Age Priority. This has the following implications:

- The concept of *free transactions* has been removed. High Coin Age Priority transactions would previously be allowed to be relayed even if they didn't attach a miner fee. This is no longer possible since there is no concept of Coin Age Priority. The `-limitfreerelay` and `-relaypriority` options which controlled relay of free transactions have therefore been removed.
- The `-sendfreetransactions` option has been removed, since almost all miners do not include transactions which do not attach a transaction fee.
- The `-blockprioritysize` option has been removed.
- The `estimatepriority` and `estimatesmartpriority` RPCs have been removed.
- The `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempooolentry` and `getrawmempool` RPCs no longer return `startingpriority` and `currentpriority`.
- The `prioritisetransaction` RPC no longer takes a `priority_delta` argument, which is replaced by a `dummy` argument for backwards compatibility with clients using positional arguments. The RPC is still used to change the apparent fee-rate of the transaction by using the `fee_delta` argument.
- `-minrelaytxfee` can now be set to 0. If `minrelaytxfee` is set, then fees smaller than `minrelaytxfee` (per kB) are rejected from relaying, mining and transaction creation. This defaults to 1000 satoshi/kB.
- The `-printpriority` option has been updated to only output the fee rate and hash of transactions included in a block by the mining code.

Mempool Persistence Across Restarts
-----------------------------------

Version 0.14 introduced mempool persistence across restarts (the mempool is saved to a `mempool.dat` file in the data directory prior to shutdown and restores the mempool when the node is restarted). Version 0.15 allows this feature to be switched on or off using the `-persistmempool` command-line option. By default, the option is set to true, and the mempool is saved on shutdown and reloaded on startup. If set to false, the `mempool.dat` file will not be loaded on startup or saved on shutdown.

New RPC methods
---------------

Version 0.15 introduces several new RPC methods:

- `abortrescan` stops current wallet rescan, e.g. when triggered by an `importprivkey` call.
- `combinerawtransaction` accepts a JSON array of raw transactions and combines them into a single raw transaction.
- `estimaterawfee` returns raw fee data so that customized logic can be implemented to analyze the data and calculate estimates.
- `getchaintxstats` returns statistics about the total number and rate of transactions
  in the chain.
- `listwallets` lists wallets which are currently loaded. See the *Multi-wallet* section
  of these release notes for full details.
- `uptime` returns the total runtime of the `bitcoind` server since its last start.

Low-level RPC changes
---------------------

- When using Bitcoin Core in multi-wallet mode, RPC requests for wallet methods must specify
  the wallet that they're intended for. See the *Multi-wallet* section of these release
  notes for full details.

- The new database model no longer stores information about transaction
  versions of unspent outputs. This means that:
  - The `gettxout` RPC no longer has a `version` field in the response.
  - The `gettxoutsetinfo` RPC reports `hash_serialized_2` instead of `hash_serialized`,
    which does not commit to the transaction versions of unspent outputs, but does
    commit to the height and coinbase information.
  - The `gettxoutsetinfo` response now contains `disk_size` and `bogosize` instead of
    `bytes_serialized`. The first is a more accurate estimate of actual disk usage, but
    is not deterministic. The second is unrelated to disk usage, but is a
    database-independent metric of UTXO set size: it counts every UTXO entry as 50 + the
    length of its scriptPubKey.
  - The `getutxos` REST path no longer reports the `txvers` field in JSON format,
    and always reports 0 for transaction versions in the binary format

- `signrawtransaction` can no longer be used to combine multiple transactions into a single transaction. Instead, use the new `combinerawtransaction` RPC.

- `fundrawtransaction` no longer accepts a `reserveChangeKey` option. This option used to allow RPC users to fund a raw transaction using an key from the keypool for the change address without removing it from the available keys in the keypool. The key could then be re-used for a `getnewaddress` call, which could potentially result in confusing or dangerous behaviour.

- `estimatepriority` and `estimatesmartpriority` have been removed. See the *Removal of Coin Age Priority* section for full details.

- The `listunspent` RPC now takes a `query_options` argument, which is a JSON object
  containing one or more of the following members:
  - `minimumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum value of each UTXO
  - `maximumAmount` - a number specifying the maximum value of each UTXO
  - `maximumCount` - a number specifying the minimum number of UTXOs
  - `minimumSumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum sum value of all UTXOs

- The `getmempoolancestors`, `getmempooldescendants`, `getmempooolentry` and `getrawmempool` RPCs no longer return `startingpriority` and `currentpriority`. See the *Removal of Coin Age Priority* section for full details.

- The `dumpwallet` RPC now returns the full absolute path to the dumped wallet. (it
  used to return no value, even if successful.

- In the `getpeerinfo` RPC, the return object for each peer now returns an `addrbind` member, which contains the ip address and port of the connection to the peer. This is in addition to the `addrlocal` member which contains the ip address and port of the local node as reported by the peer.

- The `disconnectnode` RPC can now disconnect a node specified by node ID (as well as by IP address/port). To disconnect a node based on node ID, call the RPC with the new `nodeid` argument.

- The second argument in `prioritisetransaction` has been renamed from `priority_delta` to `dummy` since Bitcoin Core no longer has a concept of coin age priority. The `dummy` argument has no functional effect, but is retained for positional argument compatibility. See the *Removal of Coin Age Priority* section for full details.

- The second argument in the `submitblock` RPC argument has been renamed from `parameters` to `dummy`. This argument never had any effect, and the renaming is simply to communicate this fact to the user.
  (Clients should, however, use positional arguments for `submitblock` in order to be compatible with BIP 22.)

- Error codes have been updated to be more accurate for the following error cases:
  - `getblock` now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the block can't be found on disk (for
  example if the block has been pruned). Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
  - `pruneblockchain` now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the blocks cannot be pruned
  because the node is not in pruned mode. Previously returned RPC_METHOD_NOT_FOUND.
  - `pruneblockchain` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the blocks cannot be pruned
  because the supplied timestamp is too late. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
  - `pruneblockchain` now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the blocks cannot be pruned
  because the blockchain is too short. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
  - `setban` now returns RPC_CLIENT_INVALID_IP_OR_SUBNET if the supplied IP address
  or subnet is invalid. Previously returned RPC_CLIENT_NODE_ALREADY_ADDED.
  - `setban` now returns RPC_CLIENT_INVALID_IP_OR_SUBNET if the user tries to unban
  a node that has not previously been banned. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `removeprunedfunds` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if `bitcoind` is unable to remove
  the transaction. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
  - `removeprunedfunds` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the transaction does not
  exist in the wallet. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
  - `fundrawtransaction` now returns RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY if an invalid change
  address is provided. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER.
  - `fundrawtransaction` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if `bitcoind` is unable to create
  the transaction. The error message provides further details. Previously returned
  RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the provided transaction has
  descendants in the wallet. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the provided transaction has
  descendants in the mempool. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has
  has been mined or conflicts with a mined transaction. Previously returned
  RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction is not
  BIP 125 replaceable. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has already
  been bumped by a different transaction. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_REQUEST.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction contains
  inputs which don't belong to this wallet. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has multiple change
  outputs. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has no change
  output. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the fee is too high. Previously returned
  RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the fee is too low. Previously returned
  RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the change output is too small to bump the
  fee. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.
