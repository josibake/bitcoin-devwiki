Compatibility
==============

Bitcoin Core is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support).
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Bitcoin Core should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

Notable changes
===============

Performance Improvements
------------------------

V0.15 contains a number of significant performance improvements, which make
Initial Block Download, transaction and block validation much faster:

- The chainstate database (which is used for tracking UTXOs) has been changed
  from a per-transaction model to a per-TXO model. Advantages of this model
  are that it:
    - avoids the CPU overhead of deserializing and serializing the unused outputs;
    - has more predictable memory usage;
    - is adaptable to various cache flushing strategies.

  As a result, validating the blockchain during Initial Block Download (IBD) and reindex
  is ~30-40% faster, uses 10-20% less memory, and flushes to disk far less frequently.
- In previous versions, signature validation for transactions has been cached when the
  transaction is accepted to the mempool. V0.15 extends this to cache the entire script
  result. This means that if a transaction in a block has already been accepted to the
  mempool, the ScriptSig does not need to be re-evaluated. Empirical tests show that
  block validation is now 40-50% faster.
- levelDB has been upgraded to V1.20. This version contains hardware acceleration for CRC
  on architectures supporting SSE 4.2. As a result, IBD and block validation are now faster.
- SHA256 hashing has been hardware optimized for architectures supporting SSE 4. SHA256
  is around 50% faster on supported hardware, which results in around 5% faster IBD and
  block validation. In V0.15, SHA256 hardware optimization is disabled in release builds by
  default, and can be enabled by using `--enable-experimental-asm` when building.

Multi-wallet support
--------------------

Bitcoin Core now supports loading multiple, separate wallets. The wallets are completely segregated, with individual balances, keys and received transactions.

Multi-wallet is enabled by using more than one `-wallet` argument when starting Bitcoin, either on the command line or in the Bitcoin config file.

In Bitcoin-qt, only the first wallet will be displayed and accessible for creating and signing transactions. However, the other wallets will continue to remain synchronized to the node's current tip in the background. This can be useful if running a pruned node, since loading a wallet where the most recent sync is beyond the pruned height results in having to download and revalidate the whole blockchain. Continuing to synchronize all wallets in the background avoids this problem.

Bitcoin v0.15.0 contains the following changes to the RPC interface and bitcoin-cli for multi-wallet:

* When running Bitcoin with a single wallet, there are **no** changes to the RPC interface or bitcoin-cli. All RPC calls and bitcoin-cli commands continue to work as before.
* When running Bitcoin with multi-wallet, all *node-level* RPC methods continue to work as before. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the normal `<RPC IP address>:<RPC port>/` endpoint, and bitcoin-cli commands should be run as before. A *node-level* RPC method is any method which does not require access to the wallet.
* When running Bitcoin with multi-wallet, *wallet-level* RPC methods must specify the wallet for which they're intended in every request. HTTP RPC requests should be send to the `<RPC IP address>:<RPC port>/wallet/<wallet name>/` endpoint, for example `127.0.0.1:8332/wallet/wallet1.dat/`. bitcoin-cli commands should be run with a `-rpcwallet` option, for example `bitcoin-cli -rpcwallet=wallet1.dat getbalance`.
* A new *node-level* `listwallets` RPC method is added to display which wallets are currently loaded. The names returned by this method are the same as those used in the HTTP endpoint and for the `rpcwallet` argument.

Note that multi-wallet is fully supported from v0.15.0, the multi-wallet interface should be considered unstable for v0.15.0, and there may backwards-incompatible changes in future versions.

Changes to the estimatesmartfee API
-----------------------------------

The `estimatesmartfee` RPC interface has changed:

- The `nblocks` argument has been renamed to `conf_target` (to
  be consistent with other RPC methods).
- The `conservative` argument has been removed and replaced by
  an `estimate_mode` argument. This argument takes one of the
  following strings: `CONSERVATIVE`, `ECONOMICAL` or `UNSET`
  (which defaults to `CONSERVATIVE`). Selecting `CONSERVATIVE`
  will potentially return a higher feerate and is more likely
  to be sufficient for the desired target, but is not as
  responsive to short term drops in the prevailing fee market.
- The RPC return object now contains an `errors` member, which
  returns errors encountered during processing.
- If Bitcoin has not been running for long enough and has not
  seen enough blocks or transactions to produce an accurate fee
  estimation, an error will be returned (previously a negative
  value `feerate` was returned).

Mempool Persistence Across Restarts
-----------------------------------

V0.14 introduced mempool persistence across restarts (the mempool is saved to a `mempool.dat` file in the data directory prior to shutdown and restores the mempool when the node is restarted). V0.15 allows this feature to be switched on or off using the `-persistmempool` command-line option. By default, the option is set to true, and the mempool is saved on shutdown and reloaded on startup. If set to false, the `mempool.dat` file will not be loaded on startup or saved on shutdown.

New RPC methods
---------------

V0.15 introduces several new RPC methods:

- `abortrescan` stops current wallet rescan, e.g. when triggered by an `importprivkey` call.
- `combinerawtransaction` accepts a json array of raw transactions and combines them into a single raw transaction.
- `getchaintxstats` returns statistics about the total number and rate of transactions
  in the chain.
- `listwallets` lists wallets which are currently loaded. See the *Multi-wallet* section
  of these release notes for full details.
- `uptime` returns the total uptime of the server.

Low-level RPC changes
---------------------

- When using Bitcoin in multi-wallet mode, RPC requests for wallet methods must specify
  the wallet that they're intended for. See the *Multi-wallet* section of these release
  notes for full details.

- The new database model no longer stores information about transaction
  versions of unspent outputs. This means that:
  - The `gettxout` RPC no longer has a `version` field in the response.
  - The `gettxoutsetinfo` RPC reports `hash_serialized_2` instead of `hash_serialized`,
    which does not commit to the transaction versions of unspent outputs, but does
    commit to the height and coinbase information.
  - The `gettxoutsetinfo` response now contains `disk_size` and `bogosize` instead of
    `bytes_serialized`. The first is a more accurate estimate of actual disk usage, but
    is not deterministic. The second is unrelated to disk usage, but is a
    database-independent metric of UTXO set size: it counts every UTXO entry as 50 + the
    length of its scriptPubKey.
  - The `getutxos` REST path no longer reports the `txvers` field in JSON format,
    and always reports 0 for transaction versions in the binary format

- `signrawtransaction` can no longer be used to combine multiple transactions into a single transaction. Instead, use the new `combinerawtransaction` RPC.

- `fundrawtransaction` no longer accepts a `reserveChangeKey` option. This option used to allow RPC users to fund a raw transaction using an key from the keypool for the change address without removing it from the available keys in the keypool. The key could then be re-used for a `getnewaddress` call, which could potentially result in confusing or dangerous behaviour.

- The `listunspent` RPC now takes a `query_options` argument, which is a json object
  containing one or more of the following members:
  - `minimumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum value of each UTXO
  - `maximumAmount` - a number specifying the maximum value of each UTXO
  - `maximumCount` - a number specifying the minimum number of UTXOs
  - `minimumSumAmount` - a number specifying the minimum sum value of all UTXOs

- The `dumpwallet` RPC now returns the full absolute path to the dumped wallet. (it
  used to return no value, even if successful.

- In the `getpeerinfo` RPC, the return object for each peer now returns an `addrbind` member, which contains the ip address and port of the connection to the peer. This is in addition to the `addrlocal` member which contains the ip address and port of the local node as reported by the peer.

- The `disconnectnode` RPC can now disconnect a node specified by node ID instead of by IP address/port. To disconnect a node based on node ID, call the RPC with the new `nodeid` argument.

- The second argument in `prioritisetransaction` has been renamed from `priority_delta` to `dummy` since Bitcoin Core no longer has a concept of coin age priority. The `dummy` argument has no functional effect, but is retained for compatibility with clients that were using positional arguments. 

- The second argument in the `submitblock` RPC argument has been renamed from `parameters` to `dummy`. This argument never had any effect, and the renaming is simply to communicate this fact to the user.

- Error codes have been updated to be more accurate for the following error cases:
  - `getblock` now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the block can't be found on disk (for
  example if the block has been pruned). Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
  - `pruneblockchain` now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the blocks cannot be pruned
  because the node is not in pruned mode. Previously returned RPC_METHOD_NOT_FOUND.
  - `pruneblockchain` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the blocks cannot be pruned
  because the supplied timestamp is too late. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
  - `pruneblockchain` now returns RPC_MISC_ERROR if the blocks cannot be pruned
  because the blockchain is too short. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
  - `setban` now returns RPC_CLIENT_INVALID_IP_OR_SUBNET if the supplied IP address
  or subnet is invalid. Previously returned RPC_CLIENT_NODE_ALREADY_ADDED.
  - `setban` now returns RPC_CLIENT_INVALID_IP_OR_SUBNET if the user tries to unban
  a node that has not previously been banned. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `removeprunedfunds` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if bitcoind is unable to remove
  the transaction. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
  - `removeprunedfunds` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the transaction does not
  exist in the wallet. Previously returned RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
  - `fundrawtransaction` now returns RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY if an invalid change
  address is provided. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER.
  - `fundrawtransaction` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if bitcoind is unable to create
  the transaction. The error message provides further details. Previously returned
  RPC_INTERNAL_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the provided transaction has
  descendants in the wallet. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_INVALID_PARAMETER if the provided transaction has
  descendants in the mempool. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has
  has been mined or conflicts with a mined transaction. Previously returned
  RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction is not
  BIP 125 replaceable. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has already
  been bumped by a different transaction. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_REQUEST.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction contains
  inputs which don't belong to this wallet. Previously returned RPC_INVALID_ADDRESS_OR_KEY.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has multiple change
  outputs. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the provided transaction has no change
  output. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the fee is too high. Previously returned
  RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the fee is too low. Previously returned
  RPC_MISC_ERROR.
  - `bumpfee` now returns RPC_WALLET_ERROR if the change output is too small to bump the
  fee. Previously returned RPC_MISC_ERROR.
