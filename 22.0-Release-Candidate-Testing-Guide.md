# Testing Guide: Bitcoin Core 22.0 Release Candidate

This document outlines some of the upcoming Bitcoin Core 22.0 release changes and provides steps to help. This is meant to get you started on testing, but is in no way comprehensive! After running through the steps in this guide, you are _encouraged_ to do your own testing. 

This can be as simple as testing the same features in this guide, but trying it a different way. Even better, think of features you use regularly and test that they still work as expected in the release candidate. You can also read the [release notes](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/22.0-Release-Notes-draft) to find something not covered in this guide. This is a great way to be involved with Bitcoin's development and helps keep Bitcoin running smoothly and bug free! Your help in this endevour is _greatly_ appreciated.

## Overview

For a full description of major changes in `22.0`, check out the [release notes](https://github-wiki-see.page/m/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/22.0-Release-Notes-draft). This guide covers:

- Tor v2 address support removed
- Support for I2P connections 
- Support for hardware wallets in GUI/RPC (External Signers)
- The new GUIX build system

Minor changes (not covered in this guide, but feel free to test them):

- Lots of RPC updates
- Filesystem changes (moving from .dat to .json)
- `natmp` option added

## Preparation

#### 1. Grab Latest Release Candidate

**Current Release Candidate:** [Bitcoin Core 22.0rc2](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v22.0rc2) [(changelog)](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/bitcoin-devwiki/wiki/22.0-Release-Notes-Draft)

There are two ways to grab the latest release candidate: pre-compiled binary or source code.
The source code for the latest release can be grabbed from here: [latest release source code](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/releases/tag/v22.0rc2).

If you want to use a binary, make sure to grab the correct one for your system. There are individual binaries for [macOS](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-22.0/test.rc2/x86_64-apple-darwin18/bitcoin-22.0rc2-osx64.tar.gz), [Linux](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-22.0/test.rc2/x86_64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-22.0rc2-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz), [Arm (64 bit)](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-22.0/test.rc2/aarch64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-22.0rc2-aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz), [Arm (32 bit)](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-22.0/test.rc2/arm-linux-gnueabihf/bitcoin-22.0rc2-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz), and [RISC-V](https://bitcoincore.org/bin/bitcoin-core-22.0/test.rc2/riscv64-linux-gnu/bitcoin-22.0rc2-riscv64-linux-gnu.tar.gz).

#### 2. Compile Release Candidate

**If you grabbed a binary, skip this step.**

Before compiling, make sure that your system has all the right dependencies installed. As this guide utilizes the Bitcoin Core GUI, you must compile support for the GUI and have the `qt5` dependency already installed. To test the new wallet changes, make sure that you installed the `sqlite3` dependency. To compile with sqlite support, run the following:

```bash
./autogen.sh
./configure --with-sqlite=yes --without-bdb
make -j <number of cores>
```

For more information on compiling from source, here are some guides to compile Bitcoin Core for [UNIX/Linux](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-unix.md), [macOS](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-osx.md), [Windows](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-windows.md), [FreeBSD](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-freebsd.md), [NetBSD](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-netbsd.md), and [OpenBSD](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/build-openbsd.md).

#### 4. Using this guide

If you plan to use the command line, here are a few environment variables to set depending on whether you are using the downloaded or source code compiled binary. First, create a temporary data directory:

 
``` bash
export DATA_DIR=/tmp/22-rc-test
mkdir $DATA_DIR
```

Next, specify the path to the binary you will be using. For source compiled, start from the root of your release candidate directory and run:

```bash
export BINARY_PATH=$(pwd)/src
export QT_PATH=$(pwd)/src/qt
```

For the downloaded binary, cd start from the root of the downloaded release candidate (`cd ~/bitcoin`, for example) and run:

```bash
export BINARY_PATH=$(pwd)/bin
export QT_PATH=$BINARY_PATH
```

The commands throught the rest of the guide will look like:

```bash
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR [cli args]

# for starting bitcoin-qt
$QT_PATH/bitcoin-qt -datadir=$DATA_DIR [cli args]
```

Between sections in this guide, it's recommended to stop your node and wipe the data directory. You can use the commands provided below.

**Stop node**

```bash
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR stop
```

**Wipe and recreate the directory**

```bash
rm -r $DATA_DIR
mkdir $DATA_DIR
```

**Start node**

```bash
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoind -datadir=$DATA_DIR -daemon
```

**Using QT**

If you'r not comfortable with the command line, still test all of these changes in the GUI after making the appropriate conf file changes. To run bitcoin-qt, use:

```bash
$QT_PATH/bitcoin-qt -datadir=$DATA_DIR
```

And then check the appropriate tabs to verify the steps

---

## Testing Tor Changes

Support for Tor v3 was released in `0.21` and now in `22.0` Bitcoin Core will only connect to Tor v3 peers. This is due to Tor v2 no longer being supported by the Tor project. For more info on this, you can checkout their [deprecation timeline](https://blog.torproject.org/v2-deprecation-timeline). To test this, we are going to instruct our node to only connect to some previously known Tor v2 nodes and verify that we don't see anything in our network peers dashboard. We will then tell it to connect to known v3 addresses and verify we now have peers. To complete these steps, you will need to have Tor installed. For instructions on installing Tor, checkout out the [previous release guide](link).

If Tor is installed, create a bitcoin.conf file in your test data directory:

```bash
touch $DATA_DIR/bitcoin.conf
```

and add the following lines:

```bash
proxy=127.0.0.1:9050 #If you use Windows, this could possibly be 127.0.0.1:9150 in some cases.
listen=1
bind=127.0.0.1
onlynet=onion

connect=ygwcypmb2qiotrp3.onion:8333
connect=stcwaszw352kkjis.onion:8333
connect=nrrmkgmulpgsbwlt.onion
connect=orrxr4kfntzawea3.onion:8333
connect=q2fhnnyt5b2ayvce.onion
connect=rk4vbyca7xnn3top.onion
connect=7ndbwnmgbyupv47f.onion
connect=bitcoinzi27kiwf6.onion
connect=w4ja2rt6wvqn6rfw.onion:8333
connect=6maigxjvcet4pite.onion:8333
connect=cehok4dxukhnoopi.onion:8333
connect=r6apa5ssujxbwd34.onion:8333
connect=ggvnc3v5pmrlsupw.onion:8333
connect=er4mwkhxzxgavrvo.onion:8333
connect=35yncj7et6k3koqy.onion
connect=nesxfmano25clfvn.onion:8333
connect=5d5vtnm6xlsqzq7p.onion
connect=34jtv2p5pw4e5bp3.onion
connect=z5nt64xh4d3vnll2.onion
connect=lncmdma3namzrbnx.onion:8333
connect=lncmdmx7ezlplcck.onion:8333
connect=lncmdmgoddecttey.onion:8444
```

Now, start the node on mainnet by running:

```bash
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoind -datadir=$DATA_DIR -daemon
```

Check that we are running and doing an initial block download:

```bash
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR -getinfo
```

If you run this command a few times, you should see `"verificationprogress"` and "blocks"` increasing. This indicates we are in IBD. Now lets check our peers dashboard with:

```bash
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR -netinfo 4
```

It should be empty. This is because in the release candidate, we are ignoring Tor v2 peers, but we are still able to connect to them for IBD. You can verify this by running:

```bash
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR getpeerinfo
```

You should get a json response about your connected peers and you will see onion v2 addresses, matching the list you specified in `bitcoin.conf`. This is because we can still connect to peers for initial block download, but will ignore them otherwise.

Next, let's add some Tor v3 addresses to `bitcoin.conf`. Stop your node, open the conf file and add the following lines:

```bash
addnode=sxjbhmhob2xasx3vdsy5ke5j5jwecmh3ca4wbs7wf6sg4g2lm3mbszqd.onion:8333
addnode=rp7k2go3s5lyj3fnj6zn62ktarlrsft2ohlsxkyd7v3e3idqyptvread.onion:8333
addnode=d6jwdcoo2l3gbjps6asgg4nhp2gn5oao3wj333o43ssqnjaliehytfad.onion:8333
```

Restart your node and run the the netinfo dashboard:

```bash
wait $BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR -netinfo 4
```

After a minute or so you should see a few v3 peers show up. Congrats, you're running over Tor using v3 addresses! Stop your node and wipe the data directory before moving on to the next section.

## Testing I2P

You can now run Bitcoin Core over I2P! If this is the first you're hearing about it, checkout [https://geti2p.net/en/](https://geti2p.net/en/) for more info. Running over I2P is not a new idea and was being discussed as far back as [2011](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=10003.0). There was even a forked Bitcoin client that could run over I2P. But now it's officially in Core. This helps Bitcoin's censorship resistance and also helps the network be more resistant to eclipse attacks!  Here we are testing that your node can find and connect to other I2P nodes. We are restricting to only I2P in the test, but restricting on your actual node is not recommended until more I2P nodes are running. First, install I2P by running (or follow instructions for your OS):

```bash
apt install i2pd
systemctl enable i2pd.service
systemctl start i2pd.service
```

Add the following to your `bitcoin.conf`:

```bash
debug=i2p
onlynet=i2p
i2psam=127.0.0.1:7656

addnode=72l3ucjkuscrbiiepoehuwqgknyzgo7zuix5ty4puwrkyhtmnsga.b32.i2p:0
addnode=c4gfnttsuwqomiygupdqqqyy5y5emnk5c73hrfvatri67prd7vyq.b32.i2p:0
addnode=gehtac45oaghz54ypyopim64mql7oad2bqclla74l6tfeolzmodq.b32.i2p:0
addnode=h3r6bkn46qxftwja53pxiykntegfyfjqtnzbm6iv6r5mungmqgmq.b32.i2p:0
addnode=hnbbyjpxx54623l555sta7pocy3se4sdgmuebi5k6reesz5rjp6q.b32.i2p:0
addnode=pjs7or2ctvteeo5tu4bwyrtydeuhqhvdprtujn4daxr75jpebjxa.b32.i2p:0
addnode=wwbw7nqr3ahkqv62cuqfwgtneekvvpnuc4i4f6yo7tpoqjswvcwa.b32.i2p:0
addnode=zsxwyo6qcn3chqzwxnseusqgsnuw3maqnztkiypyfxtya4snkoka.b32.i2p:0
```

Since I2P is brand new, there aren't many nodes and it may take a minute to connect to other I2P peers. We'll use the same command as before to keep the netinfo dashboard running:

```bash
watch $BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR -netinfo 4
```

You should eventually see connected peers, which means you are successfully running over I2P! Make sure to stop and wipe your data directory before moving on to the next section.

## Testing Wallet Changes

This section takes a little more setup as it involves downloading an HWI and fully syncing to signet (1~5 minutes, depending on your internet). It is also best tested using the GUI, but commands for testing via the cli are provided at the end. To start, make sure you have a fresh, empty data directory and start the GUI on signet:

```bash
$QT_PATH/bitcoin-qt -datadir=$DATA_DIR -signet
```

While your node syncs, follow the instructions for downloading and installing the HWI. Using git, you can run:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:bitcoin-core/HWI.git
cd HWI
pip install .
```

or follow the installation instructions found [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI). If you're on linux, you will also need to install the udev rules file. You can run the following command to install udev rules for all wallets:

```bash
sudo ./hwi.py installudevrules
```

or, if you only want to install a particular one, you can find the appropriate [udev rules](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/blob/master/hwilib/udev/README.md) and place the file in `/etc/udev/rules.d/` (make sure to keep the same filename).

If you don't have a HW wallet (or don't want to use your existing HW for testing), you can use an emulator. Instructions for installing the Trezor emulator can be found [here](https://docs.trezor.io/trezor-firmware/core/emulator/index.html), or you can use the Coldcard emulator (MacOS only) from [here](https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware).

For the Trezor emulator, make sure you are running Trezor bridge with the `-e 21325` option. If `trezord` is already running on your system, you will need to stop it and restart it with the `-e 21324` option. Finally, if you are using the Trezor emulator, delete the `keepkey.py` file from `HWI/hwilib/devices/`, otherwise the emulator will think that both a keepkey and trezor are connected when you run the emulator, causing an error (more info on this issue [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI/issues/517)).

Once you have your HW connected or the emulator started, cd into the directory for HWI and run `./hwi.py enumerate`. You should see something like the following:

```bash
[{"type": "<device type>", "model": "<device name>", "path": "0003:000a:00", "needs_pin_sent": false, "needs_passphrase_sent": false, "fingerprint": "<device fingerprint>"}]
```

Now we need to tell BitcoinQT about the HWI script. To do this, go to Settings > Options > Wallet and add the path to the script in "External signer script path" like so:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7444140/128353420-01afe763-20c9-4cee-9702-d3ade53dc1d5.png)

After this is done, you will need to restart the GUI. Close it out and run the same command as above to start it on on signet. Now click Create Wallet (either from the menu or from the front page) and you should see External Signer automatically selected with the name of the wallet pre-filled as the name of your device. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7444140/128353667-e18ccb97-4e64-4a22-9431-80a47d9c9514.png)

Create the wallet and next we can test accepting and sending a transaction using a faucet (your node should be fully synced to signet by this point).

### Testing with a faucet

If you already have a faucet you're familiar with using, generate a receive address and use it to get coins. Alternatively, there is a script in `bitcoin/contrib/signet/` that you can use to get test coins. To use, generate a new address, cd into the release candidate directory and run the following script:

```
./contrib/signet/getcoins.py -c $BINARY_PATH -a <your receive address>
```

You should see something like the following:

```bash
Payment of 0.00100000 BTC sent with txid 0c7bd2778d67c0b82852d696bb3264ec27b897e181d357c6fe9b63d51e25c7e6
```

Wait for your transaction to be confirmed and you will have test coins in your wallet (you can check the status at [https://mempool.space/signet](https://mempool.space/signet)


### Sending and signing a transaction

Once you have a balance confirmed in your wallet, generate a new receive address, copy it, and click Send. Using your new address (self transfer), fill in the values for the transaction, make sure your hardware wallet is plugged in and unlocked, and click sign on device. Follow the steps to sign on the device and you should see the UI automatically update once finished. Congratulations, you've completed a transaction using only Bitcoin Core and a hardware wallet!

If you'd like to test using the HWI from the cli, start `bitcoind` using the `-signer` option like so:

```bash
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoind -datadir=$DATA_DIR -daemon -signer=/path/to/HWI/hwi.py
```

You can test more of the HWI functionality from the commandline. To start, close the QT, start `bitcoind` and try creating a wallet:

```bash
$BINARY_PATH/bitcoin-cli -datadir=$DATA_DIR -signet -named createwallet wallet_name="ext_sign_test" disable_private_keys=true descriptors=true external_signer=true
```

For more information and some example commands you can use to test, check out the external signers document [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/external-signer.md)

## Testing GUIX builds

This is for the more adventerous among you! Bitcoin 22.0 uses GUIX as the new build system. GUIX builds are a big improvement in the security and trustless-ness of Bitcoin's builds as it allows for a fully auditable and reproducible build. More specifically, building the release candidate gives us confidence there are not reproducibility bugs the the release and we can also use the GUIX build process on a specific PR to give us confidence the PR is not introducing a reproducibility bug.

For the purpose of this guide, you will be building the release candidate. However, if you'd like to see an example of the build system being used on a PR, checkout this one: [bitcoin/bitcoin#22552](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/22552)

To build the release candidate, download the source code (if you haven't already) and cd into the directory. Alternatively, if you have the git repo cloned, you can also run the following command to switch to the release candidate:

```bash
git switch v22.0rc2 --detach
```

Make sure you've followed the guide [here](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/contrib/guix/README.md) for setting up and installing GUIX and then run the following to start a build:

```
./contrib/guix/guix-build
```

You can also follow this guide for a good overview of build and verifying: [guix build workflow](https://gist.github.com/hebasto/7293726cbfcd0b58e1cfd5418316cee3)
